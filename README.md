In our world of technology the old methods of voting are being changed to match the trends in 
the other fields of life. The voting is migrating from the conventional ballot papers and boxes to 
the electronic methods.
This project presents a way to develop an electronic voting machine which displays the count of 
votes on a 16x2 LCD interface. A user can cast his/her vote through set of four switches (one for 
each candidate). After every cast of vote, the respective LED glows and buzzer buzzes. The 
voting is started by pressing the start switch after which the user is prompted to vote. The 
count of votes is stored in four different variables. As soon as the user votes for a candidate by 
pressing one of the switches, the value of the corresponding variable is increased by one. After 
this a Thank you message is displayed on LCD to acknowledge the registration of userâ€™s vote. 
The message stays on the screen until either the start button to cast another vote or Stop 
switch is pressed to get the poll results. When the stop button is pressed, the names of the 
candidates are displayed along with their vote counts. After some delay, the result is displayed 
which could be either declaration of the winner candidate or the candidates with a clash.
